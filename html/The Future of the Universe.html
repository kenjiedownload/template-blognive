					Let us look at the future of the Universe to understand what will become of the stars in the long term and what would be the possibilities of survival in a universe that will become colder and whose energy resources will be exhausted.<br><br> Our tool is the Big Bang theory that describes not only the past of the universe but also its future. Taking place in eons that are in multiples of billions of billions of years or even more, we can assume that no one will be there to describe what is really happening or to rectify our assumptions.<br><br> However, intellectually the future is always an exciting subject, even if by nature it is close to science fiction with all the possible slippages. But by strictly and simply applying the laws of physics and thermodynamics, this future remains predictable despite a certain margin of inaccuracy related to the properties of stars and processes that have a wide range of features including functions mass and body temperature.				<div align="center">
